You can add a monster to a quick-reference list, called My PHS. The acronym PHS comes from the game, and stands for Personal Handheld System. In this app, it is your dashboard where you can view monsters you've saved. You can open up these to see the monster you have saved, and delete it when you are done.

When you add a monster to this list, you will give it a nickname, and a note.

You can also add monsters to the database. Clicking on "Add new" sends you to the appropriate form. When you add a monster, your user name will be displayed in the entry for that monster under "Added by".

Lastly, the Config page is experimental, but is open for you to enjoy. In the original game, you could configure the background of your menu in a similar fashion. This is inluded now simply for nostalgia, and will be further implemented into the app in the future.
